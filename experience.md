## Research Experience

### Spectral Extremal Graphs of Planar Graphs with Fixed Size (Jul 2024 - Oct 2024)
- **Location**: Shanghai, China
- **Role**: Lead author | Supervisor: Prof. Liying Kang
- **Methodological Approach**:
  - A lower bound on $$\rho(G)$$ was given by the conjectured extremal example, where $$G$$ was always assumed to be an extremal graph.
  - Using the leading eigenvector of $$A(G)$$, we deduced that there were two vertices $$u', u''$$ whose entries in the leading eigenvector were close to 1.
  - The entries of the leading eigenvector corresponding to vertices in $$V\setminus \{u', u''\}$$ were very small, and the degrees of vertices in $$V\setminus \{u', u''\}$$ were at most 2.
  - Based on these properties, we refined the structure of $$G$$. We showed that it must be the conjectured graph.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Proved that for outerplanar graphs with $$m \geq 64$$ edges, the extremal graph is $$S_m$$, a star.
  - For planar graphs, showed the extremal graph as $$K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2} K_1$$ when $$m$$ is odd and sufficiently large, and $$K_1 \vee (S_{\frac{m-2}{2}} \cup K_1)$$ when $$m$$ is even and sufficiently large.

### Spectral Extremal Graphs in Planar Graphs (Oct 2024 - present)
- **Location**: Shanghai, China
- **Role**: Researcher | Supervisor: Prof. Liying Kang
- **Current Progress**:
  - For sufficiently large $$n$$, the maximum spectral radius and the unique extremal graph were determined for all planar graphs on $$n$$ vertices that do not contain $$Fan_k$$ as a subgraph, where $$Fan_k = K_1 \vee P_{k-1}$$.
  - The conjecture by Boots and Royle, and independently by Cao and Vince, positing that for $$n \geq 9$$, the planar graph with the maximum spectral radius is $$P_2 \vee P_{n-2}$$, held for $$n$$ greater than $$10^9$$.
