## Research Experience

### Spectral Extremal Graphs of Planar Graphs with Fixed Size (Jul 2024 - Oct 2024)
- **Location**: Shanghai, China
- **Role**: Lead author | Supervisor: Prof. Liying Kang

- **Methodological Approach**:
  - A lower bound on </math>\rho(G)</math> was given by the conjectured extremal example, where </math>G</math> was always assumed to be an extremal graph.
  - Using the leading eigenvector of </math>A(G)</math>, we deduced that there were two vertices </math>u', u''</math> whose entries in the leading eigenvector were close to 1.
  - The entries of the leading eigenvector corresponding to vertices in </math>V\setminus \{u', u''\}</math> were very small, and the degrees of vertices in </math>V\setminus \{u', u''\}</math> were at most 2.
  - Based on these properties, we refined the structure of </math>G</math>. We showed that it must be the conjectured graph.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Proved that for outerplanar graphs with </math>m \geq 64</math> edges, the extremal graph is </math>S_m</math>, a star.
  - For planar graphs, showed the extremal graph as </math>K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2} K_1</math> when </math>m</math> is odd and sufficiently large, and </math>K_1 \vee (S_{\frac{m-2}{2}} \cup K_1)</math> when </math>m</math> is even and sufficiently large.

### Spectral Extremal Graphs in Planar Graphs (Oct 2024 - present)
- **Location**: Shanghai, China
- **Role**: Researcher | Supervisor: Prof. Liying Kang

- **Current Progress**:
  - For sufficiently large </math>n</math>, the maximum spectral radius and the unique extremal graph were determined for all planar graphs on </math>n</math> vertices that do not contain </math>Fan_k</math> as a subgraph, where </math>Fan_k = K_1 \vee P_{k-1}</math>.
  - The conjecture by Boots and Royle, and independently by Cao and Vince, positing that for </math>n \geq 9</math>, the planar graph with the maximum spectral radius is </math>P_2 \vee P_{n-2}</math>, held for </math>n</math> greater than </math>10^9</math>.
