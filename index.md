# About Me

<img src="https://liangdongfan.github.io/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Liangdong Fan(Faraday , 范良东)**.<br>

I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Shanghai University, advised by [Prof. Liying Kang](https://en.math.shu.edu.cn/info/1017/1586.htm). 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - liangdongfanshu@gmail.com

## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a summer research opportunity for 2025. If you have any information or opportunities, please contact me!</font>**

- [Extremal Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_graph_theory)
- [Spectral Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory)
- [Planar Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph)

 These are areas I have previously explored. However, as an undergraduate student, my future interests extend beyond these topics. I am keenly interested in various aspects of Combinatorics and graph theory, such as hypergraphs, graph coloring, and structural graph theory, etc. I am eager to contribute significantly to these fields with the guidance of a mentor, potentially you!
